# Test LOPC data processing
# Use a short mission for testing: dorado 2010.341.00 http://stoqs.mbari.org/p/SVGDeLc
# The complete_dorado_processing fixture will process the mission and create takes
# 10+ minutes to run.  We need a faster test for lopc data processing.

# Rely on a fixture to wget the log files for this mission and test that the lopc
# processing works as expected.

# TODO: Implement this
