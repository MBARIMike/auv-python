# Python code for processing MBARI Dorado-class AUV instrument data

The code here is used to process Dorado-class AUV data from the original
log files recorded by the vehicle's main vehicle computer into more
interoperable netCDF files.

There is a rich collection of Matlab code (e.g. the Science Data Processing
toolbox) that already does this and the code here will inherit much of the
institutional knowledge that has been baked into that code base over the
last 20 years or so.

The goals of this are:

* Able to use for any Dorado class vehicle: Gulper, i2map, mapping
* Both ship-based local file and production MBARI network execution
* Decouple quick-look plot generation -- this code does only data processing
* All available metadata written to netCDF attributes, including new XML cals
* Decouple plumbing lag settings from the code
* Enable easy reprocessing of segments of the archive
* Create derived products suitable for loading into STOQS

This [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pYqrfa3pJw4KtgGbZMKW7zjr9cESR3GjoSUNJWJh2UY/edit?usp=sharing)
gives some background on the motivation for these goals.

### How do I use this  ###

This requires Python 3.8 and is initially being developed on a STOQS development system.
